title: About Programming Port
---
Programming Port is a blog website, whose niche is **Tech** and **Programming**. That means here I post articles related to programming, coding and ways to improve your coding skills. 

A blog website is a very good medium to convey your thoughts and opinion to the community or any specific group of people. By this tech blog my goal is to explore more things in the field of software development and as well as I want to discover more enthusiastic people about tech and programming like me in the "Dev Community".

**About Me**

I am engineering student from computer science. Life in engineering is little bit tough but also fun at the same time ;)

My main work domain is website development and blockchain development, inspite of that I also have some basic knowledge about other field like data visualisation using python and had done an introductory course on making cross-platform mobile apps using flutter.

That's not all of it I also like do to some stuff other than coding, like I had played football on national level and also love to watch it, other than that I like movies too.

That's all about me, you can connect with we on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_mishra10) , [Telegram](https://t.me/rahul_mishra10) , [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-mishra-66210b185) , [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rahul_mishra10/?hl=en) and can share your thougths about this website or opinion about it. Feel free to do so, I will be very happy to have some responce from your side.
